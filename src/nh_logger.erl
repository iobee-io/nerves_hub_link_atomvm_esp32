%% @doc A `logger' handler that sends log events to NervesHub.
%%
%% Saves an application from calling `nerves_hub_link:send_log/3' by hand, which
%% is the difference between a logging extension that gets used and one that is
%% forgotten.
%%
%% ```
%% logger_manager:start_link(#{
%%     log_level => info,
%%     logger => [
%%         {handler, default, logger_std_h, #{}},
%%         nh_logger:handler(#{level => info})
%%     ]
%% })
%% '''
%%
%% Handlers are given to `logger_manager' when it starts and there is no
%% `add_handler/3' on AtomVM, so this is arranged by the application at startup
%% rather than by the agent when it connects. Nothing starts `logger_manager'
%% on AtomVM either: an application that wants logging at all has to start it,
%% and one that does not has no handlers for this to be added to.
%%
%% == What it does not catch ==
%%
%% Only what goes through `logger'. `io:format/2', `console:print/1' and
%% Elixir's `IO.puts/1' write straight to the console and never reach a handler,
%% and a good deal of AtomVM code — including most examples — logs that way.
%%
%% Elixir has no `Logger' on AtomVM at all: `exavmlib' does not ship one, so an
%% Elixir application calls `:logger' directly and is caught by the same
%% handler. There is nothing that can be done for `IO.puts'.
%%
%% == Messages must be charlists or reports ==
%%
%% `logger:do_log/4' accepts a list or a map and raises `badarg' on anything
%% else, so a **binary message crashes the process that logged it** before any
%% handler runs. That is upstream of this module and nothing here can soften
%% it.
%%
%% It catches Elixir code in particular, where the obvious call is the one that
%% fails:
%%
%%     :logger.info("started")            %% badarg, a binary
%%     :logger.info(~c"started")          %% fine, a charlist
%%     :logger.info(#{event => started})  %% fine, a report
%%
%% Erlang code is less exposed, since a double-quoted string is already a list
%% there.
%%
%% == Finding the agent ==
%%
%% The handler is configured before the agent exists, so it looks the agent up
%% by registered name each time. Start the agent with `register => Name' to give
%% it one. Until it is registered, and after it stops, events are dropped rather
%% than queued: a device that cannot talk to NervesHub should not spend its
%% memory remembering why.
